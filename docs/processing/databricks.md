- benefit
    - rbac
- workspace
    - spark         : workflow
    - sql analytics : post workflow serving layer for visualization
- clusters
    - under the hood, its a managed cluster running apache spark.
    - run notebooks, jobs.
    - scheduler : 
        - determines jobs access to cluster
        - uses preemption
        - threshold settings between 0-1.
        - preemption timeout : time for which a job can starve for job before preemption
        - interval : time interval between two checks done by schedule to check if a job needs resources
    - types
        - all purpose : manual start/stop/reused
            - life cycle is independent of a job (notebook / job)
        - job cluster : associated with a job
            - deleted with the job
        - single node cluster
    - pool
        - nodes available which can be added to a cluster
        - cluster requests nodes from the pool, if not available will spin up new nodes
        - nodes from the pool can be shared by cluster. reduces time to wait on nodes
    - initialization scripts
        - global
        - cluster scoped
- notebooks
- jobs
- data
    - can connect to azure services
    - it has a internal file system
